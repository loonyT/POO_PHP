Practicing object oriented programing by following this tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_NiFqLvfsc&list=PLjwdMgw5TTLVDKy8ikf5Df5fnMqY-ec16&ab_channel=Grafikart.fr

## Learning path : 

1. I commented my code a lot during the tutorial
2. I did some research when i was not getting what was explained
3. This is not a functionnal application, more a bunch of exemples
4. Those exemples are typically what you find when practicing OOP in PHP
5. OOP in PHP means : classes, MVC, middlewares, routeurs, inheritance, instanciation, ....
